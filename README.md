Question 2
=======
Type
```
./calc <testCase.txt
```
to run the test case.

Type ``` make clean ``` to clean files.


Assumptions
=======
1. When a variable is instantiate and is assigned with an int, the compiler push the int to the stack, and the stack machine pops the int out and assign it to the variable.

For example
```
a := 1;

push const int 1
assign variable a with 1
```

2. The code is based on the exercise 1 in the Assignment 4.
